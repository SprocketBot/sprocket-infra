## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Managed Services**: Database and storage migrations simplified operations
2. **Doppler Integration**: Centralized secret management was crucial
3. **Iterative Approach**: Small changes, frequent commits, test often
4. **Documentation**: Writing things down as we learned saved the project
5. **Persistence**: Many attempts before success, don't give up

### Critical Dependencies (Must Have)
1. Doppler access (secrets)
2. GitHub organization membership (auth)
3. Digital Ocean account (database, storage)
4. Pulumi backend access (state)
5. DNS control (certificates, routing)

### Biggest Challenges
1. Vault bootstrapping and unsealing automation
2. Routing complexity (local vs production)
3. Storage backend migration
4. Secret management across systems
5. Let's Encrypt certificate handling

### Most Important Lessons
1. **Use managed services for critical infrastructure** (databases, storage)
2. **Design for production first**, add dev overrides later
3. **Automate secret provisioning** to reduce human error
4. **Document decisions when making them**, not after
5. **Test each layer independently** before stacking
6. **Git history is invaluable** for understanding evolution
