## 🎮 What is Sprocket?

**For Those New to the Project**

Sprocket is a comprehensive platform for competitive Rocket League esports leagues. It provides the infrastructure and tools to run organized competitive gaming leagues similar to traditional sports leagues.

### What Sprocket Does

**For Players**:
- **Register and Create Profiles**: Link gaming accounts (Epic Games, Steam, Xbox, PlayStation)
- **Join Leagues and Teams**: Find teams, join competitive leagues, track player stats
- **Compete in Matches**: Scheduled matches with proper matchmaking and rankings
- **Track Performance**: View statistics, ELO ratings, match history, and leaderboards
- **Integrate with Discord**: Receive notifications, submit scores, check schedules without leaving Discord

**For League Administrators**:
- **Manage Leagues**: Create seasons, configure rules, set match schedules
- **Matchmaking**: Automated team matching based on skill ratings
- **Results Processing**: Parse Rocket League replay files automatically, verify match results
- **Analytics**: Track league health, player engagement, match completion rates
- **Communication**: Automated Discord notifications for matches, results, and announcements

**For Spectators**:
- **Browse Matches**: View upcoming and past matches
- **Player Stats**: Research players and team performance
- **Leaderboards**: See top-ranked players and teams
- **Match Replays**: Download and watch competitive match replays

### The Business Value

**Problem Sprocket Solves**:
Before Sprocket, running a Rocket League league required:
- Manual player registration and team management (spreadsheets)
- Manual match scheduling and coordination (Discord messages)
- Manual result verification (watching replays, checking screenshots)
- Manual stat tracking (spreadsheets and databases)
- Fragmented tools (different systems for each task)

**Sprocket's Solution**:
- **All-in-one Platform**: Single integrated system for everything
- **Automation**: Replay parsing, matchmaking, notifications handled automatically
- **Discord Integration**: 70% of interactions happen via Discord bot (where players already are)
- **Scalability**: Support hundreds of players across multiple leagues simultaneously
- **Data-Driven**: Analytics and insights for league administrators

### The Tech Stack (Simplified)

**Frontend** (What users see):
- Web application built with Next.js (React)
- Discord bot for in-Discord interactions
- GraphQL API for data access

**Backend** (What makes it work):
- Microservices architecture (small, specialized services)
- PostgreSQL database (player data, matches, teams, stats)
- Redis cache (fast data access, reduce database load)
- RabbitMQ message queue (asynchronous processing)
- S3 storage (replay files, generated images)

**Infrastructure** (What this documentation is about):
- Docker Swarm (container orchestration)
- Traefik (reverse proxy, routing, HTTPS)
- Vault (secrets management)
- Grafana/InfluxDB (monitoring and metrics)
- Digital Ocean (hosting provider)

### Current Scale

As of November 2025:
- **Users**: Hundreds of active players
- **Concurrent Users**: <1,000 (current capacity)
- **Matches**: Thousands of matches recorded
- **Uptime**: 99.9%+ (less than 9 hours downtime per year)
- **Response Time**: <500ms for most requests
- **Cost**: $131/month infrastructure

### Who Uses Sprocket?

**Primary Audience**:
- Competitive Rocket League players looking for organized leagues
- League administrators running community tournaments
- Team captains managing rosters and schedules

**Geographic Distribution**:
- Primarily North American players
- Some European players
- Global community via Discord

### Why This Documentation Exists

**The Context**:
In September 2025, the Sprocket infrastructure was in a fragile state:
- Manual deployment processes
- Frequent downtime
- Difficult to maintain
- Missing critical services
- No disaster recovery plan

**The Solution**:
Over 8 weeks (September 14 - November 8, 2025), we:
1. Completely rebuilt the infrastructure from scratch
2. Adopted Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi)
3. Implemented proper secrets management (Vault)
4. Set up comprehensive monitoring (Grafana, InfluxDB)
5. Documented everything (this package)

**The Result**:
- 99.9%+ uptime
- ~6 hour recovery time (vs. days/weeks before)
- Repeatable deployments
- Comprehensive documentation
- Team can confidently operate and maintain the platform

This documentation package is that knowledge captured - everything needed to understand, deploy, operate, and maintain Sprocket's infrastructure.
